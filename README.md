# VITYARTHI-PROJECT--25BCE10909
VITYARTHI PROJECT BY DAKSH SIROHI

● Project Title:
A python code to create strong, randomized passwords using letters, numbers, and symbols.

● Overview of the Project:
This Python project is a simple yet secure password generator that takes user input for the number of letters, numbers, and symbols, and returns a randomized password. It ensures the password is unpredictable by shuffling the characters and supports customization by allowing the user to specify how many characters of each type are needed.

● Features:
- Takes custom input for letters, numbers, and symbols count.
- Combines uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special characters.
- Uses randomization to ensure strong password generation.
- Shuffles the combined password 
- Output

● Technologies/Tools Used:
- Used Python 3
- imports random module to pick random characters and shuffle randomly.
- sys and os modules also imported. 
- Command-line/terminal for user interaction.

● Steps to Install & Run the Project:
1. Install Python and make sure Python 3 is installed on your machine.
2. Save the code in a .py file (e.g., password_generator.py).
3. Open terminal or command prompt.
4. Run the file using:- python password_generator.py
5. Follow the on-screen prompts to enter counts for letters, numbers, and symbols.

● Instructions for Testing:
1. Run the script multiple times with different input combinations.
2. Test with:
   - All counts as non-zero.
   - Some counts as zero (e.g., no symbols).
   - All counts as zero (to check error message).
3. Then check whether the password output matches the expected length and contains the right mix of character types.
