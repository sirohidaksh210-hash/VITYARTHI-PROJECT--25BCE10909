Project: Password Generator

Problem Statement
In today’s digital age, secure passwords are essential to protect personal and professional data. Many users struggle to create strong, unpredictable passwords and often reuse weak ones across platforms, increasing the risk of data breaches. This project solves that problem by generating complex, random passwords with a customizable mix of letters, numbers, and symbols.

Scope of the Project

It allows users to specify the desired number of letters, symbols, and numbers, and outputs a secure, randomly shuffled password. The script ensures versatility and is suitable for local, offline use, avoiding exposure to online threats.

Target Users
- General users needing strong passwords for personal accounts
- IT professionals managing multiple credentials
- Developers and testers needing random passwords during development
- Educators teaching basic Python programming and cybersecurity concepts

High-Level Features
- Customizable password length (by choosing number of letters, symbols, and numbers)
- Random selection of characters for unpredictability


Shuffling of characters for added security
- Simple command-line interface
- Lightweight and runs without external dependencies
